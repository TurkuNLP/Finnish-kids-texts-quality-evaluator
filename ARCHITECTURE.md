# Repository architecture

The project creates controlled fluency perturbations and uses them to train and
evaluate candidate-only text quality scorers.

## End-to-end flow

```text
custom original.jsonl
  -> canonical perturbation repository and manifest
  -> optional candidate score runs
  -> source-safe HF DatasetDict
  -> regression or pairwise FE training rows
  -> trained candidate-only scorer
  -> shared evaluation suite
```

The canonical candidate graph is the boundary shared by generation, scoring,
and dataset construction. No stage reconstructs identity from filenames or
text equality.

## Canonical repository

For each custom dataset:

```text
data/custom_datasets/<dataset>/
  original.jsonl
  perturbations/
    perturbation_manifest.json
    <method>/<run_id>/<target_layer>.jsonl
  scores/
    <scoring_method>/<scoring_run_id>.jsonl
    <scoring_method>/<scoring_run_id>.errors.jsonl
    <scoring_method>/<scoring_run_id>.metadata.json
```

The manifest lists every committed method/run/layer, its source layer, source
method and run, configuration hash, content hash, counts, and output path.
Candidate records carry:

- dataset and stable base-text identity;
- globally stable candidate identity;
- perturbation method, source family, and run;
- source and target layers;
- exact parent candidate identity;
- method-specific generation metadata.

An original is represented as a stable candidate at layer 0. Every perturbed
candidate has exactly one parent. Repository validation rejects missing
parents, cross-document ancestry, duplicate candidate IDs, path/provenance
disagreement, and content-hash mismatches.

## Perturbation layer

`clumsification_code/perturbations/` contains the reusable method registry and
generation service. `scripts/generate_perturbations.py` is the single-layer
client; `scripts/prepare_dataset.py` can execute several declared generations.

Canonical method names are `llm_zero_shot`, `llm_sampled`, `unieval`,
`trad_single`, `trad_multi`, and `unieval_trad`. LLM implementations share a
runner boundary and load vLLM only when needed. The sampled method uses a
versioned JSONL edit catalog and deterministically samples, for each
candidate, the edit count, target dimensions, operations, and severity from
its stable seed.

Traditional perturbation is multilingual: English morphology uses
Lemminflect and other supported languages use UniMorph. The registry exposes
one interface regardless of implementation language.

Generation requests identify their source by `(source_method, source_run_id,
source_layer)`, or by layer 0 for originals. Consequently, layers can be
continued within one method or chained across methods without copying files.

## Candidate scoring

`clumsification_code/scoring/` loads tasks from canonical manifests and writes
versioned score records. Each record identifies:

```text
(dataset, base_text, candidate, perturbation method/run,
 scoring method/run, exact reference candidate)
```

Method, perturbation run, and target-layer filters are applied before scoring.
Reference policy is explicit: either the original candidate or the exact
parent. Score direction is normalized to higher-is-better. Errors and run
metadata are stored beside, but separately from, successful scores.

## HF composition and pairing

`clumsification_code/data/hf_dataset.py` traverses the repository graph. It
does not use historical layer directories. `HFBuildSpec` controls:

- datasets, perturbation methods, runs, and target layers;
- composition policy and method weights;
- pair policy and reuse limit;
- scoring methods and score runs;
- source-safe split ratios, downsampling, and seed.

Splitting occurs on `(dataset_name, base_text_id)` before composition and
pairing. This also applies to cross-source unmatched pairs, so all candidates
derived from one original remain in one split.

Grouped HF rows contain aligned arrays for text, layer, candidate ID, method,
run, parent ID, source layer/method/run, and requested scores. Exact provenance
therefore survives selection and shuffling.

`scripts/build_hf_dataset.py` and the HF stage of
`scripts/prepare_dataset.py` call the same `build_hf_dataset(HFBuildSpec, ...)`
service. CLI and JSON configuration are two front ends to one implementation.

## Training boundary

`clumsification_code/data/flattening.py` validates source isolation and turns
grouped HF rows into explicit training rows:

- regression: one candidate and one finite scalar target;
- pairwise: one chosen/rejected pair, with lower perturbation layer treated as
  the preferred candidate for layer-based supervision.

The FE model is candidate-only at inference. Both objectives use the same
encoder, resolved pooling rule, and scalar linear head. Teacher scores,
sources, references, method names, and layer identities are supervision or
audit metadata, never inference inputs.

`scripts/train_fe_model.py` is the canonical FE training entrypoint and uses
the Hugging Face Trainer. Evaluation adapters under
`clumsification_code/evals/` expose shared candidate-scoring interfaces to the
benchmark runner.

## Configuration contracts

`clumsification_code/data/schemas.py` defines versioned original, candidate,
score, manifest, generation, workflow, and HF-build contracts. Unknown config
fields are rejected. Example configs live under `configs/` and the complete
field descriptions are in `docs/PERTURBATION_CONFIGS.md`.

## Legacy boundary

`scripts/import_legacy_dataset.py` is the only supported route from historical
layer folders into the canonical repository. Legacy readers and deprecated
experiment scripts are not used by generation, scoring, HF building, training,
or evaluation. They are moved to ignored local archive folders during cleanup.

## Source-tree policy

Tracked files are limited to the paper's central methodology: reusable code,
user-facing local scripts, stable configs, prompt assets, and stable
documentation. Datasets, generated outputs, tests, notebooks, figures,
changing internal documents, archives, and all cluster batch jobs remain
untracked.
